    He wields a giant war hammer and has the following spells:
    
    - Heat Hammer: turns his hammer red hot, but not malleable.
    
    - Superheat Hammer: turns his heated hammer glowing yellow from the inside out.
    
    - Whitehot Hammer: turns his superheated hammer white hot, the light shed from the hammer is blinding. If an observer were to try and see, the only thing they can make out is the silhouettes of the people around them and the disintegrating silhouette of the hammer’s target. One cooled down the shadow of the target is burnt into the ground.
