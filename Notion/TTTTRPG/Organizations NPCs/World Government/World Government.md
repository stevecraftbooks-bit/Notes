# Tiers of Governance

- City/Town Kings
    
    - The lowest of the ranks, but arguably the most important. They decide how their cities or towns are run and rule closest to the people. They decided how they treat the poor, middle class and upper class. They are usually good and avoid tyranny if possible, however history has proved to have some past uprisings.
    

- World Legislature
    
    - The seven World Legislators are above the individual cities/towns. Each of them rule over a different faction. They have the power to create and enforce laws within the realm of their faction.

- World Ronins
    
    - The three World Ronins are above the World Legislature. They serve as judges to make sure the World Legislature does not fall out of line. They also protect the Executive Sages in case of emergency and have the ability to enforce any decree imposed by the World Sages or law made by the World Legislature. They are also in charge of setting and enforcing legal bounties on people who threaten the integrity of the World Government.

- Executive Sages
    
    - The two Executive Sages are above all others. Known to be the most powerful forces to live. Are still mortal bodies, but have lived for as long as anybody can remember. They can pass an executive decree if agreed upon by both or singularly give orders to the World Ronin, World Legislature, or City/Town Kings.
