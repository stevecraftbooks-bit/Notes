_Tiny water elemental_

Rain weavers are tiny mite like elementals that live within the skies. They float within the clouds and group together in large tight gatherings. Within the clouds they spend their lives weaving a cocoon out of ==[[Mireweave]]==, a very light, silk like substance excreted by the Rain Weavers after consuming cloud. When the cloud that holds a swarm of Rain Weavers gets too heavy all of the Mireweave cocoons fall from the sky and it is now up to the Rain Weavers to metamorphose into [[Thunderflies]]. If the Rain Weavers do not emerge from the Mireweave in time, they hit the ground dissipating into water, later to be reborn into another Rain Weaver and try again. The Mireweave can however, through other means, be collected and spun into garb with high magic affinity. An elemental might choose to be reborn as a Rain Weaver while in pursuit for a greater understanding of their element through the intense lifestyle or to seek a greater elemental enlightenment and to possibly seek the knowledge base of a different element (lightning).
