- Citri culture
    
    A citrian child is born from their grandparents. After birth they choose their parents whom are the ones to have their child. The grandparent tree grows from the remains of the Citri after death from age. The average Citri can live to 100-120 because of their magic construct. Due to their size a grandparent tree can only produce 1-2 children, but it’s definitely possible for more. Interracial siblings is also possible, as in an orange Citri can find lemon Citri parents, but it’s unusual and sometimes looked down upon. A Citri is born fully mature, but they have to learn their language.
