- This race has a strong magical affinity and has an easier time concentrating on magic than other races.

- Robben like to be concealed and usually wear cloaks or robes covering their body.

- Due to staying concealed they usually live under cover such as in forests or other clustered terrain.

- They use projection/illusory magic to make holographic horns, the horns not only symbolize social status, but also power.

- Speak their own language: Robbic

- Use different sized horns to determine social status; the bigger the horns the more influential, and powerful due to the more concentration needed to keep them
