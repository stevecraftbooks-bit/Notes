# Origins

The demon roots are spirits that tether the [[Mortal Plane]] with the [[Solar Plane]] through the [[Spiritual-Ethereal Plane]]. The roots gather sunlight through their solar entity, gather nutrients through their spiritual entity and water through their mortal entity.

Upon eating a demon root the host looses their ability to cast spells or access their personal mana supply in return for other great power.
