Every object has its own natural magical channel. Similar to instruments, like the symbol, that only play one tone based on their oscillation there are mono-channel magical instruments that one have one opposing magical channel and therefore only one means it dissonance.

Magical instrument artisans find ways to create objects that contain multiple channels, this lets the musician by some way switch between channels and therefore the necessary opposing channel to create different tones and sounds with one magical instrument. Although one can play a group of mono-channel magical instruments similar to a drum kit.
