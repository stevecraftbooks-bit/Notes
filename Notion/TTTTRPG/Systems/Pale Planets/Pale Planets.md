# Origins

The pale planets are celestial bodies that tether the [[Mortal Plane]] with the [[Abyssal Plane]] through the [[Astral Plane]]. The seven astral entities orbit each other in the [[Astral Plane]], but have their mortal entities scattered everywhere around the [[Mortal Plane]]. Within the [[Abyssal Plane]] they reside dormant within an abyssal entity known as The Black-Wyrm.

  

If all seven of the mortal entities are brought together, they open a physical gateway that leads to the [[Abyssal Plane]]. If this gateway is traversed by any mortal entity it will age the mortal entity by 1000 years. Out of the gateway comes The Black-Wyrm, an astral entity that will grant one wish beyond the limitations of the plane you’re on. After the wish is granted the pale planets are scattered again across the [[Mortal Plane]].
