- Calories
    
    The amount of food you can eat is determined by a Calorie limit, being 1000 + (200 x CON modifier (at least 0)).  
    After one exceeds this limit, they must roll a CON save DC(10+ 1 for every 50 calories they consume after) each time they eat. If they fail a CON save, they suffer one level of exhaustion.
    
    |Level|Effect|

    |2|Speed halved|
    |3|Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws|
    |4|Hit point maximum halved|
    |5|Speed reduced to 0|
