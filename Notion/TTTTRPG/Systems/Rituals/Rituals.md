# Knoemnbish Resolve

A [[Knoemnb]] places their pointy hat over the chest of a dying individual and chants the words in lost knoemnbish “propono de Novo”. As the [[Knoemnb]] maintains concentration the individual is sent to the spiritual plane. Upon opening their eyes they see a vast void ahead and a lone machine with a lever. Upon grabbing the lever, the machine morphs into a mechanical Knoemnb known as the Knoemnb’s Resolve. The individual must beat the resolve in combat to receive a Soulstone Gear; only craft-able by a Knoemnb’s Resolve’s knowledge from a material found in the spiritual plane; to become a [[Tinkerborn]].

# Cumulo-Sanctum

An individual must adorn a weapon with vessel bell. A specially forged bell with a clapper designed to store Ichor. Upon killing a Nimbus with this weapon, the vessel bell transforms into a cloud bell. The cloud bell now must be eaten. Upon ingestion, the individual has a violent stream of clouds erupt from their mouth as a deep _Dong_ is heard from within and their stomach fels as if there were a thunderstorm inside. Originating from their mouth, the individual’s flesh begins to turn misty as their physical constitution becomes that of a [[Demi-Nimbus]].
