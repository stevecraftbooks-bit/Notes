# Materials:

**Material Amount**: Every material found has a material amount. This is a value that dictates how much of that material you have per piece. This is used in conjunction with Material Cost when calculating how many items you need to create a certain part. Any standardized materials such as an ingot, or a plank, have a material amount of 1.

  

**Material Cost**: Every part of a weapon or tool created has a specific material cost. This value can range depending on the size of the part. You need to have enough items so that your material amount equals your material cost.

|Axehead|3.0|
|Backplate|4.0|
|Binding|0.5|
