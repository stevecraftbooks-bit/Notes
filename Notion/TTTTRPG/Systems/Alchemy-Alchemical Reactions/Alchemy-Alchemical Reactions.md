# Reaction:

An alchemical reaction consists of three parts;

- Base

- Reagent

- Heating element

Each part can be interchanged to create different effects.

A reaction can be done anywhere as long as these three conditions are met. The reaction requires a stir and occurs instantaneously upon stirring unless specified otherwise.

# Base:

Bases are the main body of the potion, the more base the more potion. The ratio of base to reagent determines strength of certain potions, the more base the weaker the potion.

  

- bases are liquids that catalyze the reaction

- Effects are based on color or origin of liquid

- Red; healing/fire

- Green; poison/acid

- Blue;water

- Yellow; lightning

- Black; void

# Reagent:

Reagents are the main ingredient of the potion. They play the biggest role in deciding the effects of the potion. The effect is based on the origins of the reagent used. Reagents vary in concentration, and how much you can use to create a strong enough product. The ratio between base and reagent is a scale between number of uses and strength.

  

- Hard; protection/damage

- Soft; Movement/

- Fine; ball shaped/projectile-like

- Herbal; healing/buff

- Mushroom; poison/variable

- Food; healing/variable

# Heating Element:

- The most basic heating element is a type of metal that heats up from magic concentration.

- Conventional fires can work too, but aren’t able to be controlled very well and can be volatile.

# Bottles, Vials, Jugs:

Bottles are standardized, glass containers that can store up to one usage worth of any potion.

Vials are standardized, magical, glass containers that can store up to three uses worth of any potion.

Jugs are standardized, enchanted, magical, glass containers that can store up to six uses worth of any potion.
