# Tethering Planes

Adjacent planes can be tethered together through various objects or means. When planes are tethered there exists a common physical object that resides within both planes. The tether can be the physical object or a non-physical connection between the two objects.

# Mortality / Spirituality

Every living thing exists simultaneously in the [[Mortal Plane]] and [[Spiritual-Ethereal Plane]]. The two entities are tethered together differently depending on its state of being. During the living creature’s life it is its own life force that tethers a dormant spirit to a motive body. The spirit exists locally within the body and is unable to interact with the [[Spiritual-Ethereal Plane]]. The body exists within the [[Mortal Plane]] and is able to interact with it freely. After the creature’s death its body remains dormant and the spirit begins to gain mobility. It is now lingering regret and other emotions that tethers a motive spirit to a dormant body. The body exists locally at the final resting place and is unable to interact with the [[Mortal Plane]] while the spirit is now able to interact with the [[Spiritual-Ethereal Plane]] freely. If a mortal body were to find itself in the [[Spiritual-Ethereal Plane]] then the body would begin to loose its mortality and gain spirituality and if a spirit were to find itself in the [[Mortal Plane]], it will begin to loose spirituality and gain mortality. However, the state of the entity will remain, so a dormant spirit in the [[Mortal Plane]] will become a dormant body.
