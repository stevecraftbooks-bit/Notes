# Appearance

The Spiritual/Ethereal Plane looks almost identical to the [[Mortal Plane]]. The main difference is a light haze that flows out and around physical objects. The haze is usually perceived as purple, however it’s not uncommon for someone to perceive it differently.

# Residents

Beings that innately exist in the Spiritual Plane are called Spirits.
